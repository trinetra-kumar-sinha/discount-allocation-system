===========================
 Test Case 1: Normal Case
===========================
Description:
- 3 hospitals with varied metrics
- Each hospital has 3 agents with different characteristics

Expected Behavior:
- Hospital allocations vary based on performance, revenue, rating, and service
- Agent allocations are distributed fairly within their hospitals

Sample Input (summarized):
- Hospital 1: High performance, medium revenue
- Hospital 2: Excellent customer rating
- Hospital 3: Low performance, average metrics

Sample Output (excerpt):
- Agent H2_A1 → ₹106711.63
- Agent H3_A3 → ₹20146.55

===============================
 Test Case 2: All-Same Scores
===============================
Description:
- All hospitals and agents have identical metrics

Expected Behavior:
- Equal allocation among all hospitals
- Equal share for agents in their hospital

Sample Input:
- All hospital metrics: 50
- All agent metrics: 50

Sample Output:
- Each hospital gets 66666.66
- Each of 3 agents per hospital gets 22222.22

====================================
 Test Case 3: Rounding Edge Case
====================================
Description:
- Single hospital, single agent
- Maxed out performance scores

Expected Behavior:
- Agent receives entire kitty
- Rounding is handled correctly

Sample Input:
- Hospital: 100 in all features
- Agent: 100 in all features

Sample Output:
- Agent gets full ₹200000.00

Notes:
- All outputs are capped by min/max per-agent limits.
- Logic ensures no hospital or agent exceeds limits.
